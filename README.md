## System-wide installation *(done once)*

Install the dependencies required to run all the supported commands/tasks:

```
curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | gpg --dearmor > microsoft.gpg
sudo install -o root -g root -m 644 microsoft.gpg /usr/share/keyrings/microsoft-archive-keyring.gpg
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64,arm64,armhf signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/microsoft-archive-keyring.gpg] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/vscode stable main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vscode.list'
sudo apt update
sudo apt install code gdb-multiarch ccache clang clangd llvm lld libguestfs-tools libssl-dev trace-cmd python3-pip jsonnet libelf-dev bison bindfs mmdebstrap proot systemtap
```

For VS Code to keep track of all the files in your kernel source tree:

```shell
sudo bash -c 'echo "fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288" >> /etc/sysctl.conf'
sudo sysctl -p
```

## Linux tree setup *(done once per kernel tree)*

Inside a fresh linux kernel tree, e.g.:

```shell
git clone https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git
cd linux
```

Create a `.vscode` directory with our config files inside:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/FlorentRevest/linux-kernel-vscode .vscode/
.vscode/tasks.sh update  # Needs to be run once to generate settings.json
```

## Extensions *(done once)*

If you open the kernel tree in VSCode. A pop-up will appear recommending
workspace extensions, install them all. Here is what they do:

*   [C/C++ via Clangd](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=llvm-vs-code-extensions.vscode-clangd)
    this integrates with a `compile_commands.json` file autogenerated on kernel
    builds.
*   [Git integration](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)
    this provides a git blame at the end of the selected line and adds many
    options to the source control tab (commit log, file history, branches
    switching etc...).
*   [x86 and x86_64 Assembly](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=13xforever.language-x86-64-assembly)
    provides syntax highlighting for asm files.
*   [ARM64 Assembly](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MKornelsen.vscode-arm64)
    same, but for arm.
*   [Device Tree](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=plorefice.devicetree)
    provides syntax highlighting for dts files.
*   [KConfig](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=luveti.kconfig)
    provides syntax highlighting for Kconfig files.
*   [Checkpatch](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=idanp.checkpatch)
    provides squiggle highlighting of checkpatch errors on file saves.
*   [Patchwork](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=florent-revest.patchwork)
    view, apply and search patches from the
    [linux patchwork instance](https://patchwork.kernel.org/).
*   [Addr2line](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=florent-revest.addr2line)
    lets users ctrl+click on addresses in backtraces and they get resolved into
    lines of code.
*   [Git send-email](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=florent-revest.git-send-email)
    facilitates sending patches or series to the list.
*   [Syzlang](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=florent-revest.vscode-syzlang)
    highlights syzkaller syscall descriptions.
*   [Syzkaller coverage](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=florent-revest.syzkaller-coverage)
    can highlight lines covered by a running instance of syz-manager fuzzing.
*   [SystemTap Assistant](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=florent-revest.systemtap-assistant)
    facilitates kernel functions or lines tracing by dynamically generating
    systemtap scripts and rendering logs received from these probes in a buffer.
*   [SystemTap](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nzh21.systemtap-syntax)
    highlights systemtap scripts.
*   [Microsoft C/C++](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools)
    only the GDB integration of this plugin is used, every features interacting
    with the code is disabled in favor of Clangd which works much better.
*   [Trailing spaces](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shardulm94.trailing-spaces)
    highlights forgotten trailing spaces.

If the pop-up didn't appear or you dismissed it:

1.  Click on the Extensions tab on the left hand side of VSCode
2.  Enter "@recommended" in the search bar
3.  Manually click the "Install" button on every extension in the "Workspace
    Recommendations" section

NOTE: You probably want either one of these extensions too (run the command in
the `Ctrl+P` dialog box):

*   [Vim emulation](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim):

    ```shell
    ext install vscodevim.vim
    ```

*   [Emacs emulation](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodeemacs.emacs):

    ```shell
    ext install vscodeemacs.emacs
    ```

## Basic usage

*   **Compile** the kernel using `Ctrl+Shift+B` (if you don't have a `.config`
    yet, it will generate a functional one automatically for you).
*   **Run** it with `F5`.
*   **Debug** with breakpoints by clicking on the left of a line number.
*   **Open** a file by name with `Ctrl+P`.
*   **Navigate** between symbol definition/declaration with `F12`.
*   Get **clang squiggles** by building the kernel once and waiting for clangd
    to index the code for a bit. Clang also supports code refactoring (symbol
    renames with `F2` for example) and auto-formatting according to kernel rules
    with `Ctrl+Shift+I`.
*   Get **`checkpatch` squiggles** by saving the current file.
*   Interact with **git** following
    [this demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQPb73Zz9qk).
*   Change the content of `TARGET_ARCH` in `.vscode/local.sh` to `arm64` to
    transparently get an *aarch64** workspace (future compilations/virtual
    machines will be `arm64`).
*   Customize per-workspace VS-Code settings the normal way (edit local
    `.vscode/settings.json`, or use `Ctrl+Shift+P` -> "Preferences: Open
    Settings (UI)"). Note that fields that exist in `settings.jsonnet` will get
    overwritten when you run the `update` task. Also, comments in your
    `.vscode/settings.json` will get deleted.
*   **Autostart** commands or codes at VM start time by modifying the content of
    `.vscode/autostart/` (eg: always run tests that exercise the kernel
    subsystem you work on).
*   Find **more helper tasks** using `Ctrl+Shift+P`, search for `Run task` and
    then pick from the list (for example you can run menuconfig, create SSH
    sessions, update to the latest version of this setup etc).
*   **Interact with your VM** from an external terminal using
    commands such as `lkv start`, `lkv ssh`, `lkv stop` etc...

Make sure to check the *Tips and Tricks* and *Interactive Playground* options
under *Help* in the menu bar to learn more about basic VS Code usage.

## Commands outside of VSCode

All tasks are implemented in the `tasks.sh` file. This script can be run from
anywhere. For example:

```shell
alias lkv=~/linux/.vscode/tasks.sh
lkv build # Equivalent to Ctrl+Shift+B
lkv start # Equivalent to F5
lkv ssh
lkv stop
lkv push ./file
lkv pull /root/file
lkv run ls /
lkv chroot
```

## Technical documentation

If you want or need to dive into the nitty-gritty of this setup:

All the VSCode config files are maintained under this git repository.
Improvement PRs can be sent to
https://github.com/FlorentRevest/linux-kernel-vscode and will be easily
fetchable by users thanks to the auto-update task (which updates `.vscode` from
there).

*   `.vscode/tasks.json` [describes per-workspace tasks to
    VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks#_custom-tasks).
    These tasks are entries under the `Ctrl+Shift+P` `Run task` dialog box. All
    task basically just call `tasks.sh` with a different command flag.
*   `.vscode/tasks.sh` is a bash script with a big switch statement that
    implements all tasks exposed by `tasks.json`. They all share a common
    preamble customizable
    locally by local.sh.
*   `.vscode/settings.jsonnet` [provides per-workspace configuration values to
    VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings) and its
    extensions. This is constructed by `tasks.sh` by evaluating
    [`settings.jsonnet`](http://depot/company/teams/security/kernel/tools/vscode/settings.jsonnet)
    with the existing settings as an input. The JSonnet file contains sane
    defaults valid for all kernel developers. For example, it specifies which
    files VSCode should ignore, how to handle spaces and tabs or how to generate
    `kernel.org` cgit links from a file path and line. Individual developers can
    then customize per-workspace settings for their kernel trees while still
    benefiting from the defaults in the JSonnet file.
*   `.vscode/syzbot.ipynb` is a reference Jupyter notebook to automate the
    repetitive aspects of reproducing a syzkaller bug. Every step along the way
    is guided.
*   `.vscode/launch.json`
    [describes how to run a VM with a debugger attached to VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_launch-configurations).
*   `.vscode/extensions.json` [describes a list of recommended extensions to
    VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_recommended-extensions).
    These are meant to be sane defaults valid for all kernel developers.
    Extensions are pulled in from
    [the VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/).
*   `.vscode/local.sh` is a local config file not updated by the auto-update
    task. It can be used to implement special features or override defaults for
    specific needs.
*   `.vscode/autostart/` contains the template for a dummy task that gets run
    at the end of the VM's boot. Before running a VM, `tasks.sh` is responsible
    for detecting changes to these files and updating the files in the VM's
    rootfs.

Note: The [Patchwork](https://github.com/FlorentRevest/vscode-patchwork) and
[Git Send Email](https://github.com/FlorentRevest/vscode-git-send-email)
extensions are homegrown and maintained in other git repositories.
Pull-requests or bug reports are also welcome there.
